# CatalogService

A small, genuinely-runnable inventory/catalog REST API, built as the starter
repo for the freeCodeCamp/NHCarrigan Summer 2026 Cohort sprint phase.

Products have a name, SKU, category, price, and stock quantity. The API
supports full CRUD, searching by name, and a dedicated stock-adjustment
endpoint that enforces "stock can never go negative" as a hard business rule.

This is a real Spring Boot app, not a toy: layered architecture (controller →
service → repository), Bean Validation on every input, a transactional
stock-adjustment path, seed data, and a test suite. The domain is
intentionally shallow so a newcomer can understand the whole codebase and
ship a meaningful PR within a day — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
for how to claim an issue.

## Stack

- Java 21, Spring Boot 3.3 (Web, Data JPA, Validation, Actuator)
- PostgreSQL 16 for local/dev/prod, via Docker Compose
- H2 (in-memory) for the test suite — no external database needed to run tests
- Maven (with the Maven Wrapper, so you don't need Maven installed globally)

## Quickstart

### Option A: Docker Compose (app + Postgres)

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This starts Postgres and the app together. The API will be available at
`http://localhost:8080` once both containers report healthy.

### Option B: Run locally against Docker Postgres

Start just the database:

```bash
docker-compose up postgres
```

Then run the app with the wrapper:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The app defaults to `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/catalog` with
credentials `catalog`/`catalog` (see `src/main/resources/application.yml`,
overridable via `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`
environment variables).

On first startup, `DataSeeder` (a `CommandLineRunner`) inserts seven sample
products if the table is empty, so there's always something to query.

### Running tests

Tests use an in-memory H2 database (configured in
`src/test/resources/application.yml`) and never touch Postgres:

```bash
./mvnw test
```

## API overview

Base path: `/api/products`

| Method | Path                     | Description                                   |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/products`          | List all products                              |
| GET    | `/api/products/{id}`     | Get a single product by id                     |
| GET    | `/api/products/search?name=` | Search products by name (substring, case-insensitive) |
| POST   | `/api/products`          | Create a product                               |
| PUT    | `/api/products/{id}`     | Replace a product's fields                     |
| DELETE | `/api/products/{id}`     | Delete a product                               |
| PATCH  | `/api/products/{id}/stock` | Adjust stock by a signed delta (`{"delta": -3}`); rejected with `422` if it would go below zero |

Health check: `GET /actuator/health` (Spring Boot Actuator).

### Example: create a product

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Desk Lamp","sku":"SKU-9001","category":"Furniture","price":22.50,"stockQuantity":30}'
```

### Example: adjust stock

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8080/api/products/1/stock \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"delta": -5}'
```

Validation failures, not-found lookups, duplicate SKUs, and insufficient-stock
errors all return a consistent JSON error body (see
`GlobalExceptionHandler`) with an appropriate HTTP status (`400`, `404`,
`409`, `422`).

All requests to the base path and its subpaths are logged with their method, path, and response status, in the format `[<method>] <path>: <status>`. For example, the stock adjustment example logs `[PATCH] /api/products/1/stock: 200`.
